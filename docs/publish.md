# Publishing Your App

Once your public app has been graduated, you can post it on our [App Gallery](https://ringcentral.com/apps) to reach our users. The App Gallery's home page is split into two sections, "Featured Apps" and "Popular Apps" which are discussed below.

## Uploading Your App Gallery Profile Info

To pubish your app, go to the "Publish" tab on your app configuration page as shown below. The App Gallery supports posting images and YouTube video links along with adding installation and support notes. Once you are satisified with your information, click "Submit to publish" and your profile info will be reviewed, and published if approved.

Featured Apps are selected from the RingCentral Connect Platform Premier Partners as well as our own apps. To join the CP3 program as at the Premier Partner level, please fill out our [parter application form](https://www.ringcentral.com/partner/isvagentform.html). Being featured is at the discretion of our Connect Platform Partner team.
