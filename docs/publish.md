# Publishing Your App

Once your public app has been graduated, you can post it on our [App Gallery](https://ringcentral.com/apps) to reach our users. The App Gallery supports posting images and YouTube video links along with adding installation and support notes.

Organizations that publish public apps are automatically enrolled in the RingCentral Connect Platform Partner (CP3) program as an Authorized Partner and able to list on our [App Gallery](https://ringcentral.com/apps). You can also create a tighter partnership program with RingCentral by enrolling as a Premier Parter. Learn more about the CP3 program on the [Connect Platform Partner Program page](https://www.ringcentral.com/partner/isv.html).

The App Gallery's home page is split into two sections, "Featured Apps" and "Popular Apps". Featured Apps are selected from our Premier partners as well as our own apps.

To pubish your app, go to the "Publish" tab on your app configuration page as shown below:
