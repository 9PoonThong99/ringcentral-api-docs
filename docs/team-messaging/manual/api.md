# Building Team Messaging Apps

RingCentral's Team Messaging, also referred to as "Glip" is a web and desktop messaging application. It provides:

* Chat
* Task assignment and management
* Calendaring and events
* File/screen sharing
* Video conferencing

## What can you build?

The Team Messaging/Glip API you allows one to automate conversational communications, synchronize notifications into a single location (greatly reducing email), and post Glip messages. The API can be combined with other APIs, such as those offered by AI or Machine Learning systems, to solve advanced use cases.

### Bots

One of the most common use cases for the Team Messaging API is "bots." Bots are agents that users within Glip can communicate with - they expose a conversional interface that allows for the completion of a number of tasks in a more natural way.

To help developers create fully featured, production-ready bots, we have created the following bot frameworks:

RingCentral has provided a number of example bots developers can work with to help craft and hone their use case.

**JavaScript Bots**

* [Ping Bot](https://github.com/tylerlong/glip-ping-chatbot/) - this is the simplest bot one can build. It responds "pong" whenever someone types "ping."
* [Crontab Bot](https://github.com/tylerlong/glip-crontab-chatbot) - a bot to edit a list of scheduled tasks via a variety of simple commands. 
* [Google Drive Bot](https://github.com/tylerlong/glip-google-drive-chatbot) - a bot that will post messages whenever files are added and updated to a linked Google Drive account.
* [RingCentral Assistant Bot](https://github.com/ringcentral/rc-assistant) - a bot to manage your RingCentral account in a variety of ways.

**Python Bots**

* [Date/Time Bot](https://github.com/zxdong262/ringcentral-date-time-chatbot) - a bot that displays the current date and/or time. 
* [Poll Bot](https://github.com/zxdong262/ringcentral-poll-bot) - a bot that allows you to create and post a survey and store the results in a Google sheet. 
* [Translation Bot](https://github.com/zxdong262/ringcentral-translate-bot) - a bot to assist in foreign language translation.
