This guide presents key features of **RingCentral Connect Platform API**.

**RingCentral** provides the #1 cloud communications solution: all-inclusive phone system with online meetings, messaging, and [more](https://www.ringcentral.com/).

**RingCentral API** is based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. REST is not a standard but an architectural style, and it uses the following standards:

* HTTP
* URL
* XML/HTML/GIF/JPEG/etc. (resource representations)
* text/xml, text/html, application/json, image/jpeg, etc. (MIME Types)

REST allows you to access the API in the same way you would access a web server. Whenever you want to access any API service, send a standard HTTP command to a particular resource that represents the required functionality. Every API service is represented by a specific endpoint that is accessed by its own URI via sending standard requests using HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

One of the key advantages of REST architecture is simplicity. You can build your application on the fly without any additional tools, development kits or specifications. If you know how to interact with a simple web server, then you are ready to use the RingCentral API.

We also provide [SDKs](https://developers.ringcentral.com/library/sdks.html) for quicker development.

You can find [full specification](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-docs/latest/index.html) and [code dependent tutorials](https://ringcentral.github.io/tutorials/) at our [Developer Portal](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-and-docs.html).
