# RingCentral Developer Guide

This guide is intended to help developers build applications using the RingCentral API. The API allows development of customized software solutions based on the RingCentral business phone service.

**What is [RingCentral](http://www.ringcentral.com)?** RingCentral provides a cloud-based virtual business phone system that is connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the traditional global telephone network. RingCentral clients can access and configure their phone system on a Service Web, and also via free mobile apps running on tablets and smartphones. No additional phone hardware is required as the clients can use RingCentral softphones or redirect calls to their existing phones. All phones are connected through a single corporate phone number provided by RingCentral, or through an existing phone, thus unifying all phone communication services. This enables companies to be more responsive to their customers and facilitate internal communication. A call to a client is usually processed as follows:

1. The caller is greeted by an auto-attendant reporting company name and available extensions.

2. The call may be forwarded to an extension the caller has selected from a directory.

3. If the extension user does not pick up the phone, the call may be forwarded to the user's home or mobile phone (if the time is appropriate, as defined by the user).

4. If the call is not picked up, the caller will be asked to record a voicemail message.

5. The caller's number will be logged in the system even if the caller hangs up the phone without leaving a message.

Thus the companies are able to stay in touch with their customers, even if the employees are out of office. The service is flexible and provides nearly limitless possible configurations. RingCentral clients are typically small and medium size companies, or individuals who require a professional but low-cost business communications solution. These businesses have highly diverse requirements and not all of them can be met by RingCentral standard web and mobile services.

**The Purpose of the RingCentral API**. RingCentral API was created to cover additional business requirements and improve customer experience. The API is a powerful yet simple interface allowing development of customized and integrated solutions including web, mobile, and desktop applications with full access to the RingCentral phone service.
