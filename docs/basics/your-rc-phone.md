# Using Your RC Phone in Development

The *RingCentral Phone* application can be used to test check integration of your app with RingCentral communications services.

Download *RingCentral Phone* from our [RingCentral App Gallery](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/)

**Please note:** By default the desktop application is configured for Production. When testing you should reconfigure it for Sandbox, following the steps:

1. Launch the downloaded application.
2. When the login screen is displayed press <kbd>Cntrl</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> (for Mac <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>).
3. Press 'Sandbox' in the pop-up menu and sign in with your sandbox account credentials.
