# Using Phones in Sandbox

Every sandbox account is provisioned a different phone number than the one used in production. To place and receive calls in sandbox, we recommend using the [RingCentral Phone](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/rc-phone) available in our App Gallery. 

This may come in useful when you are developing apps that make use of:

* RingOut - to receive calls at a sandbox phone number.
* Voicemail - to retrieve, listen to, and delete voicemails.
* Call Control - to hang-up, hold, flip, forward calls placed to sandbox numbers. 

## Toggling your RingCentral Phone

Every new install of the RingCentral Phone is configured to work in production. To switch your phone to the sandbox environment, followi these steps:

1. Launch RingCentral Phone.

2. Once logged in, press ++ctrl+f2++ (for Mac ++fn+cmd+f2++), to bring up a menu to select your preferred environment.
