# Getting Started with Call Management

Call Management APIs allow you to programatically configure the flow and routing of calls in your account, including the setup of the following:

* Company's business hours
* Call Forwarding
* Call Monitoring Groups
* Call Queues
* Answering Rules
* IVR

The Quick Start guides below will guide you in using our Call Forwarding API in less than five minutes. The RingOut API sets the current user's call forwarding number to their personal phone number if another mobile number has not already been set. 

* [Javascript/Node](./node/)
* [Python](./python/)
