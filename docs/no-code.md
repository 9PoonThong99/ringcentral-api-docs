# Testing the API with *no code*

If you would like to test out the RingCentral API without worrying about creating a project, or writing any code, you can use the "Try it out" feature in the [API Reference](https://developer.ringcentral.com/api-reference). To get started, navigate to the reference, and look for a button labeled "Sign in to try it out." Once you are logged in, click the "Change App" button.
