# RingCentral Labs Solutions

RingCentral Labs solutions are a set of free, customizable, curated solutions built by RingCentral employees. They are designed to provide finished end-user solutions that solve common problems. RingCentral Labs apps are free to use, but are not official products, and should be considered community projects - these apps are not officially tested or documented.

Additionally, each project is created and published as an open source project on GitHub so they can be easily customized and used as example implementations for developers.

For help on any RingCentral Labs app please consult each project's GitHub Issues message boards - RingCentral support is not available for these applications. A list of projects is below.
