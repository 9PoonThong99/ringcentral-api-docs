# Getting Started with Voice

Voice APIs integrate voice and calling functionality into key business apps like CRMs or customer support systems. Customize your apps to make and receive calls, listen to recorded messages, and get
real-time notifications directly within the system.

The Quick Start guides below will guide you in using our RingOut API in less than five minutes. The RingOut API connects any two phone numbers in a call together by dialing the caller. When the caller picks up, the recipient will be called.
